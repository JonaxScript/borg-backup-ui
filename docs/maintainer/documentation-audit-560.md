# Documentation audit and coverage (#560)

## Baseline and evidence

Audit started 2026-10-11 against `origin/main`
`6df5bb0614c04af345f493a36c820ba855645934`. Stable manifest fetched from the
published main URL matches the checkout: `2026.10.09.1435`. Its package provenance
records source `54785a9720ba525d77f2e037d169b88410a78953`, base
`d3b2e70bd7ae73c253f0051ca2b0c9ec2cfcc29f`, source digest
`4100019c1a79340538d7cf1f33ab7b7c9f028e142f49f14eb85ce776a3bd10cb`.
The test channel also advertised `2026.10.09.1435` at the start of the audit.
GitHub Releases has no entries; publication is the plugin manifest/package,
not a GitHub Release. Website branch #559 and hook-example branch #557 are
excluded. No product behavior from either branch is documented as released.

All 25 existing PNGs per language were refreshed on 2026-10-11, including
the eight numbered guides. Existing paths stay stable. The isolated synthetic
application demo provides 33 views per language and one shared Grafana main
dashboard with charts. See the
[capture inventory](../user-manual/assets/README.md) for provenance and limits.

## Inventory and structural decision

Reviewed README, docs index, manual entry/readme, both canonical manuals, both
quick-help files, historical help proposal, Apprise provider catalog, integration
and hook-example guides, authentication recovery, maintainer release/support
instructions, changelog/manifest/package provenance, help JS/CSS and packaging
and language tests. All 50 existing PNG assets are refreshed; 67 additional lossless PNGs
cover current application views and the Grafana overview.
Both manuals replace all 20 old embedded references and add images for current
wizard steps, notifications, integrations, real restore results and Grafana.

Keep the two canonical long manuals and existing menu chapters. Four entry routes
and sections 16-18 provide tutorial, tasks, reference and concepts without a new
framework or independently maintained copies. Promote notification/integration
subheadings, preserving their anchors. Homepage remains in General; Prometheus
and notification settings have their own UI areas.

## Findings

Locations below use stable section/function names rather than line numbers
that change while editing. P0 concerns data safety or false assurance; P1
incorrect workflows/navigation; P2 editorial quality.

| Priority | Location and finding | Executable evidence | User impact | Correction and verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | help.md/help.en.md Restore Tests; manuals 8.3: L2 described as sample restore, L3 vague | `runtime/scripts/borg_restore_test.py:RestoreTest._test_repo_locked` (class method); `extract --dry-run`, `extract --stdout`, SHA-256 accumulation | False confidence in written files/application recovery | Explicit methods, scope, writes and limitations in both manuals/help; semantic regression checks |
| P0 | Manual 8: report is stored per job but latest archive is repository-wide | runner uses `list --short --last 1`, no archive filter | A different job's archive can supply the evidence | Prominent limitation and manual archive selection; separate product finding below |
| P0 | Manual 8: successful status/coverage can overstate verification | full dry-run timeout 124 accepted if sampled entries exist; L1 returns success even after `info` failure | Incomplete checks can look successful | Document concrete limits, require command/step review and actual restore; product fixes excluded |
| P0 | Manual 9.10 and recovery scattered | `settings_transfer_api.py:export_jobs_bundle`, `export_jobs_bundle_encrypted`, `export_profile_secrets_backup`; `job_scripts.py:store_path` | Missing secrets or central hook definitions after disaster | Exact format matrix, separate key/script backup and recovery order |
| P1 | Manuals header and assets README: mixed dates/functions | stable package provenance; current UI/source | Reader cannot identify applicable version | Separate behavior baseline, documentation revision, screenshot date and new renderer candidate |
| P1 | Manual 3.5: type/location key | `job_identity.py`, `wizard_api.py`, `wizard.js`, actual `wiz-job-id`/`wiz-archive-prefix` inputs | Wrong expectations for rename/repository change | UUID/name/prefix/history distinction and ten actual steps |
| P1 | Manual 11.4 vs 8.2, short help: interval-only plan | `restore_tests_api.py`, `schedule_api.py`, `restore-tests.js` | Wrong calendar and evidence-expiry setup | Calendar/manual/legacy distinction; missed-slot and timezone guidance |
| P1 | `help.js:_renderHelpMarkdown`, `_renderHelpToc` | Existing renderer has no table branch, strips accents and collapses hyphens unlike GitHub links | Broken tables, TOC and companion links | Safe focused renderer, consistent heading IDs and legacy alias resolution; executable JS tests |
| P1 | `plugin/build.sh` manual copy block | Only two manuals and assets copied | Offline provider/hook links fail | Explicit companion packaging plus link/asset/package tests |
| P1 | `test_i18n_resources.py` | Old version and exact line-count assertions | Green tests preserve wrong content | Semantic contracts, real links and executed renderer checks |
| P1 | Manual 10 and 11; settings 9.1 | actual help tabs and settings navigation | Tasks buried, notification/integration location wrong | Four entry routes, complete tutorial/recovery and task prerequisites/checks |
| P2 | `help-improvements.md`, terminology, historic issue references | Existing proposals are not implemented behavior | Confuses planning and released features | Mark historical review, separate maintenance guide, remove issue asides from normal prose |

## Separate product findings (no product logic changed)

1. Restore evidence can use another job's archive in a shared repository.
2. A full L2 dry-run timing out with exit 124 can be recorded as passed based on
   a preselected list, without proof that those files were read. Never interpret
   that percentage as independently measured coverage.
3. L1 reports overall success after failed `borg info`; inspect individual steps.
4. L2 reports an integrity command labelled `sha256 sample compare` without that
   operation; L3 computes hashes but has no independent expected-hash comparison.
5. L3 streams have no explicit per-file timeout in this path. Global dry-run
   limits are not a timeout guarantee for that phase.
6. Job bundles carry hook references but no central script inventory. Recreate
   definitions and reassign hooks before enabling imported jobs.

These are source findings, not claims of a reproduced production incident.

## Coverage matrix

C = executable code inspected; S = documentation/static checks; P = practical
execution; O = still requires an actual Unraid/environment test. A passing text
or unit test does not imply a successful real backup or restored application.

## Validation record

Recorded 2026-10-11 before the final source commit:

- **Static/source checks:** all maintained local links, fragments and image
  references resolve. Both languages retain the original menu anchors. Review
  covers tutorial, recovery, roles, exports, retention and restore-test limits;
  this is a reviewed coverage matrix, not a claim derived from keyword counts.
- **Focused automated tests:** 56 passed across documentation, i18n, remaining UI
  and release workflow. Executed JS covers tables, nested lists, code escaping,
  blocked executable URLs, Unicode/duplicate/legacy anchors, selected view and
  out-of-order responses. The actual packaging copier is exercised and every
  shipped companion is covered by the candidate source digest.
- **GitHub rendering:** both manuals passed through GitHub's Markdown API;
  each final manual produces 10 tables and 35 images, plus lists and code
  blocks. The API does not emit
  heading IDs; fragment resolution is checked separately by the source checker
  and real help DOM. This is not a claim that the API checked browser navigation.
- **Browser/component execution:** real help markup, JS, CSS, translations and
  staged offline documents served by the application's HTTP handler on loopback.
  Verified German/English, quick/manual/companion return, search, TOC, Unicode
  fragments, loaded images, light/dark and 390x844 viewport. Page width did not
  overflow; tables scroll within their containers. No console errors observed.
  Test-only screenshots are under `.release-tmp/docs-560/help-*.png`, not installed
  product screenshots. The component harness adds language/theme controls and
  is not represented as a full Unraid application session.
- **Practical Borg test:** bundled Borg 1.4.5, isolated repository-local synthetic
  data, `repokey-blake2` initialization/key export, `lz4` create, archive listing,
  info, dry-run (destination stayed empty), stdout read, real extract, independent
  `cmp`, and `check --verify-data` all returned 0. One known 29-byte text file
  compared byte-for-byte. This validates Borg methods, not the complete plugin
  wizard, L1/L2/L3 runner, or application-data recovery. Local execution record:
  `.release-tmp/docs-560/borg-smoke/result.json`.
- **Help navigation regression:** reproduced a 137-pixel automatic scroll when
  switching to the manual, hiding the header and tabs and focusing search.
  The fixed reader passed 20 header-position checks across German/English at
  1886 and 390 pixels: manual, companion, return, quick help and refresh.
  Chapter links still reach their target. JS regression coverage also verifies
  search focus, stale responses and hidden reloads that must not scroll other
  pages. Focused documentation/i18n/UI checks: 38 passed. Records:
  `.release-tmp/docs-560/help-scroll-before.json` and `help-scroll-after.json`.
- **Independent desktop help scrolling:** reproduced a 600-pixel document
  wheel scroll that moved the entire page and shifted the chapter sidebar from
  152.5 to 16 pixels. The bounded desktop workspace passed 12 combinations of
  German/English, quick/manual and 1886/1280/1024-pixel widths. Document and
  chapter-list wheel scrolling, boundary containment, keyboard PageDown, chapter
  targets and stationary header/search/navigation were checked. The 390-pixel
  stacked fallback remains usable without horizontal overflow. Both help images
  and their compatibility aliases were recaptured. Record:
  `.release-tmp/docs-560/help-panes-qa.json`. Focused checks: 38 passed.
- **Final gates:** full preflight, candidate build and published package checks
  are recorded against the exact final commit in the PR. They cannot be claimed
  before execution and must not require editing this commit afterward.

- **Full application demo:** normal authentication and migrations in an isolated
  mount/PID namespace, repository-local synthetic `/mnt/user/demo` fixtures,
  actual application code and bundled Borg. The job completed Pre, create,
  prune/compact/check and Post successfully. A real L2 dry-run completed.
  Browse & Restore selected one file and one folder, prechecked an empty
  destination and restored 14 files. A separate byte-for-byte comparison
  matched every file. Record: `.release-tmp/docs-560/unraid-demo/restore-verification.json`.
  This extends the initial component/CLI tests; the first preview's missing
  Unraid mount layout was resolved with private mounts, without host-root
  changes or application validation bypasses.
- **Current images:** native bilingual UI captures, reviewed representative
  settings/wizard/restore/help views and real Grafana dashboard with synthetic
  Prometheus data. All current assets and their source dimensions are catalogued. Following
  maintainer feedback, JPEG previews were replaced by direct lossless PNG
  captures at 2x device scale, with complete long settings pages.
  All eight guides have fresh numbered outlines and matching localized captions.
  Final application-help QA loads all 35 embedded images per language, checks
  the Grafana TOC target and tests light/dark at 390 pixels without page overflow
  or page errors. Record: `.release-tmp/docs-560/png-qa.json`.
  Only the Grafana datasource binding was adapted for demo provisioning.

## Remaining validation and acceptance limits

This host is not Unraid. Initial installation/setup on a fresh Unraid host,
fresh-host recovery, real USB/SMB/SSH devices, mail delivery and Docker/VM
shutdown/recovery remain maintainer tests. Current screenshots demonstrate the
application UI and synthetic local workflow, not those environment integrations.

All 50 existing PNG paths contain refreshed captures, including newly placed
numbered callouts. Canonical manuals embed current images only. Missing hardware/setup captures are explicit in the
capture inventory. Product findings above remain open; this change corrects
documentation and help delivery without changing backup/restore behavior.
